# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird Full Game with obstacles using Object Oriented Programming

Flappy Bird Remastered:
This game is named as Remastered because it has a different approach to it. The bird has to avoid obstacles and move within the pipes but at the same time there is a red angry bird chasing it and shoots a bullet at it which can reduce the flappy birdâ€™s life.
The game ends when the flappy bird collides with the pipes or if its lives end.
